A Psyduck is over there. He cannot swim across the river. There is a sign placed by the Team Rocket, suggests that the river is quite shallow.
"Go back into the Pokeball, I can throw the ball to the other side!"
"Go ahead, Psyduck!"
Psyduck cannot understand you. He stood until his owner came.
The Team Rocket shows up with fancy background music, took the Psyduck away.
