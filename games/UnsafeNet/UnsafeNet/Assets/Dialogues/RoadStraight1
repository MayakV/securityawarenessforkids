You see an abandoned rubber duck on the road. From the stain of tears on it, you can easily identify that a mysterious creature called "bug", destroyed his owner's life.
You find a new owner for the rubber duck.
You laugh at his miserable story.
The rubber thanked you, silently.
It will not help you and bless you when you write a bug later. SAD!
