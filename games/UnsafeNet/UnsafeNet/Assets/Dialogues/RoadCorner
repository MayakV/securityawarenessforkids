You see a duck on the road and yell at you, "Quak, Quak, Quak quak?" (Translation: Where is the farm?)
"Quak quak, ja quak quak quak qu-quak? Quak quakkka quaaaa quakka. Qua kakakaka......" (Translation: Right there.)
"Quak." (Translation: I don't know where is the location, but on a forum someone said it's near the roast-duck restaurant over there.)
The duck thanked you.
The duck fainted after you said it.
